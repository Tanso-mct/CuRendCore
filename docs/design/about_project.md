# About Project
CuRendCore (Cuda Render Core) is a library using CUDA toolkit, Direct3D's texture, Direct2D and WindowsAPI. These are the background and purpose of why I started to create this library.

## Background
I started to create this type of library by using JavaScript when I was a third grade of high school. I tried to create 3D game by using JavaScript but it is hard to use any exist 3D library for me at that time, so I create a 3D shooting game by using own 3d rendering program which does not include texture mapping. This is the first time to learn about 3D rendering. I feel so excited when I was creating 3D rendering program by JavaScript, and this is one reason why I want to create 3D rendering library.
My future is the other reason. I want to create any other type of game in the future so I must learn about rendering and programming. I think to create some 2d and 3d rendering library is one of the good way to learn about 3dcg and programming.
These are the reason why I started to create 3d and 2d rendering library, but there is another big reason. I like to create rendering library. This is the most important reason for me.

## Purpose
CuRendCore provides users with rendering functions using the CUDA Toolkit and input and output functions used for games. The rendering function should be compatible with both 2D and 3D.
